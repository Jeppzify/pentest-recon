# pentest-recon
Script to run common scan-/recon-tools within Kali with a single command

A small project created only to explore scripting with bash.
Could be handy in CTFs or boot2root if you don't like typing too much and just need some basic recon.
For now it only runs Nmap and GoBuster but I might add more tools and options in the future.


Usage: ./pentest-recon option ip-addr

Options:
-a, --all		    Run all tools against the target.
-n, --nmap 		  Run a full Nmap portscan with service detection and default scripts.
-g, --gobuster 	Run GoBuster against port 80 with "raft-medium-directories.txt", checking for
			          files with extensions html and php as well.
