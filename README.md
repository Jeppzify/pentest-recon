# pentest-recon
Script to run common scan-/recon-tools within Kali with a single command

A small project only created to explore scripting with flags and arguments in bash.

Could be handy in CTFs or boot2root if you don't like typing too much and just need to quickly run some basic recon.
For now it only runs Nmap and GoBuster but I might add more tools and options in the future.


```
Usage: ./pentest-recon.sh option target-ip

Options:
-a, --all	Run all tools against the target.
-n, --nmap      Run a full Nmap portscan with service detection and default scripts.
-g, --gobuster 	Run GoBuster against port 80 with "raft-medium-directories.txt", checking for
		files with extensions html and php as well.
```
